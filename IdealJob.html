								<h2>Skills Required and Skills I Have</h2>
								<p>The skills necessary for this position are not just education based, the ability to work on a team and listen to the people around you is crucial. Of course there are education based requirements, outstandingly is the need for C++ knowledge or a similar language. 4 years of professional software development experience could potentially be seen as a hurdle also.</p>
								<p>The skills i have are definitely lacking for a position of this calibre currently. Although, the ability to work in a team has always been a strong point for myself, I work well at taking in every members information and using it all to progress the cause. The professional experience required will come with time, once i have completed this course, its just a matter of waiting until i have achieved this.</p>
								<h2>Plan To Achieve Requirements</h2>
								<p>As i undertake this course to its completion, i am hoping that with enough energy, i can push through and create time for myself to learn other programming languages, this way, i may be able to open more doors than would otherwise be available. Through the link to the job page, they have included at the bottom that there are curently no openings for recent graduates. This may change over the next few years and positions for those who are inexperienced may be available. These kind of opportunities would be my aim for acheiving the experience required to apply for my current ideal job.</p>
