									<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
									<p>There are many ways i want to follow an IT career but i will stick with what 
										first caught my interest.</p>
									<p><strong>Game Development Software Engineer</strong>.</p>
								</header>
								<p class="content"> As i had discussed previously, one of my biggest interests is the amount of effort that goes into each update pushed to the public with games like Dota 2.
										    The job that i have found is advertised under the company Valve and is a senior position to work toward. As a Game Development software Engineer, you take in feedback from within the company and externally and use that information to form future content or updates that coincide with relevant needs. As a consumer, i have always seen that game communities always appreciate a company that responds well to feedback, and this role is appealing for exactly that reason.

						<!-- Third Section -->
							<section id="second" class="main special">
								<header class="major">
									<h2>Prject Idea</h2>
									<p> </p>
									<p><strong>Happy News App</strong>.</p>
								</header>
								<p class="content"> I wish to create an app that provides relief for users throughout the day. The apps purpose is to provide positive information retrieved daily, based on the interests the user inputs.
										    The information can be from anywhere in the world and will obviously not have information for every interest every day, so the more interests entered, the better the app will run. 
										    The project for me will be to uplift the spirits of a negatively skewed social media using world.
										    Once created of course, ads may be used to generate income, as with anything we create, we want it to be worth our time.</p>
