								<h2>Motivation-</h2>
								<p>Although i do not watch live television any more, news is spread through every form of screen entertainment that exists. News spreads as one of the most important forms of information on the planet, and it often takes less than a day for anyone with a mobile or computer to know about a tragedy somewhere in the world. I wish to take this in the other direction, not to close people off from the negativity of the world, but to spread some happiness and joy. As a child i spent a lot of time at my grandparents house, and my grandad wouldnt miss a single news segment as soon as it hit 6pm. I felt like i didnt want to know about all the bad things in the world, especially the things that we have no power over changing. With this in mind i want to be able to show people like myself that there are people out their using their power to do good things.</p>
								<h2>Description-</h2>
								<p>The Project is an app that i will create. The app will eventually be coded for both apple and andriod and may also become a website that is possible to be viewed on a computer.
The app is signed into with a unique account of course, like most apps these days, so that information can be dynamic, and tailored to the specific audience using it.
Once signed in, the app may require age to be placed to further tailor information, or filter content that may be explicit for underage use.
The user is then asked to select interests, not from a selection of items, but simply using a search engine to find topics.
The user may put things in specifically for example- dolphins, or they may put in broader terms like ocean or beach.
Once the user has selected a minimum number of interests, content will be located that ticks the boxes for age and interests.
Another factor that could be determined would be level of understanding, as far as catering to target audience. 
If a middle aged woman had put in the same interests as a child, the system may be altered to find an article with a more experienced target audience, whereas the childs one may search for a simpler article, with more video content and less writing, or writing of a simpler level.
As stated earlier, this content will be located daily and interests can be added to or removed as time passes.
The more interests added, obviously the fuller the news feed may be.</p>
                <p>Later on in development, i would hope to add a suggestions feature, based on what the search engine has located that could be similar to current interests.
Not just suggestions that lead to no extra news, which would be an empty suggestion.</p>
                <p> The app could be used similarly to meditation apps and things of the like with a notification once a day, that gets the users attention to take some time out.
Reading positive information may leave the user feeling more relieved and also allow them to pass the information on to friends/family or work colleagues.
The spread of positivity will help generate a more efficient work environment, as negatively focussed workers can tend to search for more and more negatives to make themselves feel worse.
There could be specualtion on this app helping overall mental health, where a lot of people think the world is all becoming so negative as this is how news alters peoples view.</p>
                <p>As the app gains more followers, and more interest, it may be possible to have the app link to places they can donate to the causes they read about.
If the customer reads a story about say, an animal shelter clearing all its pets, they may be provided a link to a different animal shelter that needs support to help promote it and do the same.
If they were to read about a new form of renewable energy, or an alternative to plastic, they may be provided with a gofundme page or something similar to provide their support.
There is multitudes of ways in which this app could generate revenue, and knowing that only positive news is filtered through, means that none of the revenue gained will be for things damaging the planet or society.</p>
                <h2>Tools and Technologies-</h2>
								<p>As Android is the most used mobile operating system, i would be aiming to create the app there first.
Eclipse can be used with the Java software development kit, but i would look into using Android Studio, as its specifically for Android apps.
Android Studio comes with Android SDK and an Android virtual device, which is an emulator you can run your programs on.
The rest is down to actually coding the app, which can be done in java, which we are currently learning.</p>
								<p>On the other hand, if creating an Apple app, to make sure your content is available for the other 14.1% of all mobile users, you need to be running on a Mac using OSX or later.
Apple uses the Xcode graphical interface, and Apples own Swift Programming Language, along with Apple SDK, youll be all ready to code apps for Apple too.</p>
                <h2> Skills Required-</h2>
                <p>The main skill required is learning Java inside and out.
Android studio comes with some templates which may be useful, but the key to having a successfully running app is efficiency and understanding.
For the app to gain popularity it needs to be smooth running and have all the features discussed.
No special hardware would be required, only additional would be a Mac when i begin coding the Apple version.
As i progress through my course, i would hope to get my hands on some prewritten code for a different app so that i can envision what is required.
I can imagine to create a whole user interface driven by touch, would require a lot of coding and at this stage i dont have the slightest idea what it would look like or what i would be writing.</p>
                <h2>Outcome-</h2>
                <p>If this project is successful, as previously discussed, i want the outcome to be a happier world, where users spread positive news to all the people around them.
This happiness can generate assistance for the people working toward a just cause, through exposure, and monetary support.
I am hoping that the gain in positivity will cause an increase in productivity and allow people to look for more positives in the world.
This will be a form of pass it on karma, where happy people are more likely to help others and make them happy also.
As we know, the brain sees what you want it to, if you're looking for a yellow car, youll be more likely to spot a yellow car, if youre looking for the positive change, youll be more likely to work toward it.</p>
