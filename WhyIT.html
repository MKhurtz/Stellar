								<h2>My Interest</h2>
								<p>I became interested in IT as i realised that it spans from every day use such as social media, all the way up to the most specific variance, such as laser particle counters. There is an infinite number of uses for IT, its just a matter of finding something you're interested in to work on, and there is a field for you.</p>
								<p>I had been playing many different computer games from an early age and as i grew into my teens, i started thinking more and more about the tremendous effort that would be required to code them, behind what the users actually see. In games such as Dota 2 which is one of the many games that started my interest, i begun speculating on the work put into each game update or patch, and each hotfix that changed the way certain heroes or their abilities works. There are so many elements i was interested in and not only did a specific hero and its abilities have to work impeccably, but their individual interaction with every other hero and ability needed to be perfect as well.</p>
								<p>In my previous role for Apple, i worked as a senior tech assistant, but i only ever helped customers with the user interface and how to navigate or work around known bugs and issues. I had always wanted to move into the software programming team and help work on what caused the issues to originate, rather than just telling customers that i dont know why things happen, i just know how to fix them. </p>
								<h2>Why RMIT</h2>
								<p>I'm not going to pretend RMIT was a conscious decision really. I reached a point in my life where i felt i was mature enough to begin studying again and that i was ready to fit it into my current lifestyle. I progressed through the Open Universities Australia website and was looking specifically for an IT course. Having never considered Universities outside of WA, i was only really looking at places like Curtin and ECU. As i continued looking, i found the course was offered by RMIT and that there was no actual attendance required. With all things considered, if i was going to study from home anyway, there was no reason to exclude universities from other states. With that, i begun my journey. After having discussed with friends and family, it turned out that one of the friends i game with had actually attended RMIT and he provided a positive review, which cemented the decision.</p>
								<h2>What Do I Want to Gain</h2>
								<p>By attending RMIT and completing a Bachelor of IT degree I hope to gain the ability to manipulate code and work in a team environment to make any project or any item we work on, the most efficient tool that it can be. I want to work in various positions and have no specific idea of what i want to work on. I want to know how to create and code smoothly running apps or produce outstanding websites that cater specifically to a companies target audience. I want to have a broad understanding of every direction IT can take me and all the niches that it provides.</p>
